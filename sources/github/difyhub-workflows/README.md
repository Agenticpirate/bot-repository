## What is DifyHub?

DifyHub is an open-source community and platform for Dify workflows. This repository stores all the DSL files and metadata for the workflows showcased on [DifyHub.com](https://difyhub.com) (coming soon!).

Our goal is to create a central hub where anyone can find high-quality, battle-tested workflows to supercharge their Dify applications, saving you hours of building from scratch.
