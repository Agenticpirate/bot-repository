# Model Profiles

Control which LLM your assistant uses for each job — conversations, memory work, scheduled tasks — and override it per call-site when you need to.

## Overview

Model profiles control which AI model your assistant uses and how it behaves. You set one profile as the workspace-wide default, and your assistant applies it to everything — conversations, background memory work, scheduled tasks, and more. You can override it per conversation or per action type when you need different behavior.

## Built-in profiles

Every workspace starts with four built-in profiles. You can edit or duplicate them, but the defaults can't be deleted.

| Profile  | Model             | Best for                                                           |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Quality  | GPT-5.6 Sol       | Deep research, complex reasoning, high-stakes tasks                |
| Balanced | GPT-5.6 Luna      | Everyday use — capable across the board at reasonable cost         |
| Fast     | GPT-5.6 Luna      | Fast replies with reasoning off, for real-time surfaces like voice |
| Budget   | DeepSeek V4 Flash | Simple, short, or structural tasks run at high volume              |

**Balanced is active by default.** Every call your assistant makes — conversation replies, memory filing, title generation — runs with the Balanced profile unless you change it.

## Switching profiles

Open **Settings → Inference Profiles** and select a different active profile from the dropdown. The change applies workspace-wide immediately — no restart needed. You can also create custom profiles from this screen if you want to use a different provider or model not covered by the built-ins.

## Per-conversation override

Use the profile picker in the chat header to pin a different profile to a single conversation. It only affects that conversation — your workspace default stays untouched. This is the easiest way to run one session on a stronger or lighter model without changing anything globally.

## Our recommendation

Keep **Balanced** as your active profile — it covers everyday use well. Then use Action Overrides to selectively upgrade the actions that benefit most from a stronger model, and step down only for tasks where the output is purely structural.

A good rule of thumb: anything that shows up directly in your conversation or drives a decision should stay on at least Sonnet. Tasks like generating a title, formatting a notification, or suggesting conversation starters are good candidates for a lighter model — they're short, easy to verify, and quality differences are barely noticeable.

**Tip:** use the per-conversation profile picker for one-off heavy tasks. Switch to Quality for a deep research session, then leave your workspace default untouched. That way you only pay for Opus when you explicitly reach for it.

## Action overrides

Open **Settings → Inference Profiles → Action Overrides** to assign a specific profile to individual actions. Each action has a toggle — when off it uses your active profile, when on you pick a profile just for that action. You can search by name and reset everything back to defaults at any time.
