# Agentic Test Engineer

## Overview

An AI-powered autonomous testing assistant that revolutionizes QA workflows. It generates comprehensive test suites from user stories and code, self-heals broken selectors using visual AI, detects and diagnoses flaky tests, and continuously maintains test coverage metrics — all with minimal human intervention.

## Triggers

- "generate tests for [feature/code]"
- "write unit tests for [function]"
- "self-heal my broken test"
- "find flaky tests in [project]"
- "check test coverage for [module]"
- "run E2E tests for [workflow]"
- "why is my test failing"
- "智能测试生成"
- "自愈测试修复"
- "测试覆盖率分析"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Detect Context

Identify the testing scenario:
- **Unit tests**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go functions
- **Integration tests**: API endpoints, database interactions, service meshes
- **E2E tests**: Browser workflows (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium)
- **API tests**: REST/GraphQL endpoints, contract testing
- **Flaky test diagnosis**: Test results history, timing issues, async race conditions
- **Self-healing**: Broken selectors, changed DOM, moved UI elements

### Step 2: Test Generation

For test generation:
1. Analyze code structure, user story, or API spec
2. Select appropriate testing framework:
   - Python: pytest, unittest
   - JavaScript/TypeScript: Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress
   - Java: JUnit, TestNG
   - Go: testing package, testify
3. Generate comprehensive test cases:
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Negative test cases
4. Include setup/teardown fixtures
5. Add data-driven test parameters

**Worked micro-example — turning one user story into a case list**

User story: *"As a policyholder, I can upload a claim document up to 10 MB."*

| # | Case | Type | Input | Expected | Why it earns its place |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Upload a 2 MB PDF | Happy | valid.pdf | Accepted, stored, ID returned | Baseline path |
| 2 | Upload exactly 10 MB | Boundary | 10mb.pdf | Accepted | Off-by-one at the limit |
| 3 | Upload 10 MB + 1 byte | Boundary | over.pdf | Rejected with size error | The classic boundary miss |
| 4 | Upload 0-byte file | Edge | empty.pdf | Rejected, clear message | Empty file often crashes parsers |
| 5 | Upload .exe renamed .pdf | Negative | fake.pdf | Rejected on content type | Extension-only validation bypass |
| 6 | Upload while offline | Error | network drop | Retryable error, no data loss | Network path is untested by default |

Rule of thumb used above: happy path 1, boundaries 2, edge 1, negative 1, error 1.
If a generator returns 20 near-identical cases, it has enumerated values instead of risks.

**Framework selection quick map**

| Stack | Default choice | Add-on | Avoid when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python | pytest | pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio | You need strict BDD reporting → use behave |
| JS/TS (unit) | Vitest | @vitest/coverage-v8 | Legacy CommonJS with heavy jest mocks |
| JS/TS (E2E) | Playwright | trace viewer | You require real Safari on old iOS |
| Java | JUnit 5 | JaCoCo, AssertJ | You need data-driven Excel specs → TestNG |
| Go | testing | testify, go-cover-treemap | Table-driven cases need rich diffing → gotest.tools |
| API contract | Pact or OpenAPI schema check | Dredd | Provider is third-party and unstable → mock instead |


### Step 3: Self-Healing (When Triggered)

When a test breaks due to UI changes:
1. Capture the failing selector/error message
2. Use visual AI to identify the new element location
3. Generate updated selector using multiple strategies:
   - Text content matching
   - Semantic role/labels
   - Visual proximity to stable elements
   - Shadow DOM traversal
4. Validate the fix across related tests
5. Log the healing action for audit trail

**Worked micro-example — healing a renamed submit button**

```
Broken:   await page.click('.btn-primary.submit')
Symptom:  Timeout 30000ms exceeded, 0 elements matched
DOM now:  <button data-testid="policy-submit" type="submit">提交保单</button>

Candidate selectors, ranked by robustness:
1. page.getByTestId('policy-submit')        <- stable by contract, best
2. page.getByRole('button', { name: '提交保单' })  <- semantic, i18n-aware
3. page.locator('button[type="submit"]')    <- structural, survives class changes
4. page.getByText('提交保单')                <- brittle if copy changes

Chosen: 1 (with 2 as documented fallback)
Audit entry: { healed_at, old_selector, new_selector, confidence: 0.82,
               evidence: "data-testid present, unique in DOM", reviewer: pending }
```

**When NOT to auto-heal (stop and escalate instead)**

| Situation | Why auto-heal is dangerous | Correct action |
|---|---|---|
| Selector resolves to 2+ elements | Silent wrong-element clicks | Fail loudly, ask for a `data-testid` |
| The element is a legal/financial confirmation | Wrong click has real-world cost | Require human-authored selector |
| Failure appears only in production | May be a real defect, not a test problem | File a bug, do not heal |
| Healing rate > 30% of a suite in one sprint | UI is churning; tests are not the problem | Escalate to the design/dev team |
| Selector change accompanies a behaviour change | Test may now assert the wrong outcome | Re-derive assertions from the spec |

Self-healing is a maintenance aid, not a substitute for a selector contract.
If you heal the same selector twice, add a `data-testid` instead.


### Step 4: Flaky Test Detection

1. Collect test execution history from CI/CD
2. Analyze failure patterns:
   - Timing issues (race conditions, async waits)
   - Resource contention (DB connections, file locks)
   - Environment instability
   - Test interdependencies
3. Generate diagnosis report with:
   - Probability of flakiness
   - Root cause analysis
   - Recommended fixes (add explicit waits, mock external calls, etc.)

**Root-cause taxonomy (use this to classify before proposing a fix)**

| Category | Typical symptom | Diagnostic signal | Fix | How to verify the fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Async race | Passes locally, fails in CI | Failure time clusters at start-up | Explicit waits / `expect.poll` | 50 consecutive green runs |
| Test interdependency | Fails only in certain orders | Passes when run alone | Isolate fixtures, reset DB per test | Run in random order 10× |
| Shared resource | Fails under parallel load | Fails more as workers increase | Unique ports/DB schemas, no shared state | Rerun at 4× worker count |
| Time dependence | Fails at month/day boundaries | Fails on specific dates | Inject a clock, freeze time | Run with 5 faked dates |
| External dependency | Fails randomly, no code change | Network errors in logs | Mock or contract-test the boundary | Cut network, still green |
| Environment drift | Fails only on one runner | Version mismatch in logs | Pin versions, containerise | Compare runner fingerprints |
| Data pollution | Fails after other suites ran | Unexpected rows present | Transaction rollback / fresh seed | Run full suite twice in a row |

**Severity rule**: a test that flakes more than 1 in 100 runs should be quarantined
within one sprint. Quarantining is not the same as deleting — keep it running in a
non-blocking job so the signal is not lost.


### Step 5: Coverage Analysis

1. Parse code and existing test files
2. Calculate line/branch/function coverage
3. Identify untested code paths
4. Suggest priority test cases for uncovered areas
5. Generate coverage trend report

**Coverage is a triage tool, not a target — prioritise like this**

| Band | Current coverage | Risk profile | What to do first | What to ignore |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Critical path | 0–40% | Payment, underwriting, auth | Tests + contract tests + alerting | Mutation score |
| Business logic | 40–70% | Pricing, eligibility rules | Property-based tests on rules | Chasing 100% line coverage |
| Glue / adapters | 70–90% | Controllers, mappers | Integration tests at the boundary | Unit tests per branch |
| Generated code | any | DTOs, clients | Exclude from coverage denominators | Manual assertions |
| Dead code | any | Unreachable | Delete it | Testing it |

**Two coverage metrics that beat line coverage**

1. *Mutation score* — inject small faults; a suite that still passes has blind spots.
2. *Critical-path coverage* — coverage restricted to the modules that carry money or
   regulatory risk. A 60% score here matters more than 95% overall.

**Anti-pattern**: raising the coverage gate while the suite is flaky. You will get
green numbers and no confidence.


## Input/Output Examples

### Example 1: Generate Unit Tests

**Input:**
```
Generate unit tests for this Python function:
def calculate_premium(age: int, health_score: float, coverage_amount: float) -> float:
    if age < 18 or age > 70:
        raise ValueError("Age must be between 18 and 70")
    base_rate = coverage_amount * 0.05
    health_factor = 1.0 - (health_score / 100) * 0.3
    return base_rate * health_factor
```

**Output:**
```python
import pytest
from your_module import calculate_premium

class TestCalculatePremium:
    def test_happy_path(self):
        result = calculate_premium(age=30, health_score=80, coverage_amount=100000)
        assert 3000 <= result <= 5000

    def test_age_boundary_18_valid(self):
        result = calculate_premium(age=18, health_score=50, coverage_amount=100000)
        assert result == 100000 * 0.05 * (1.0 - 0.5 * 0.3)

    def test_age_boundary_70_valid(self):
        result = calculate_premium(age=70, health_score=50, coverage_amount=100000)
        assert isinstance(result, float)

    def test_age_too_young(self):
        with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Age must be between"):
            calculate_premium(age=17, health_score=80, coverage_amount=100000)

    def test_age_too_old(self):
        with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Age must be between"):
            calculate_premium(age=71, health_score=80, coverage_amount=100000)

    @pytest.mark.parametrize("health_score,expected_factor_range", [
        (0, (0.97, 1.01)),
        (50, (0.82, 0.88)),
        (100, (0.69, 0.71)),
    ])
    def test_health_factor_bounds(self, health_score, expected_factor_range):
        result = calculate_premium(age=30, health_score=health_score, coverage_amount=100000)
        lower, upper = expected_factor_range
        assert lower * 5000 <= result <= upper * 5000
```

### Example 2: Self-Healing a Broken Playwright Test

**Input:**
```
My Playwright test is failing: Selector ".submit-button" not found.
The button text is "提交保单" now.
```

**Output:**
```
🔧 Self-Healing Analysis:
- Original selector: ".submit-button"
- Issue: UI updated, element selector changed
- Healed selector strategy: text-content match

Generated alternatives:
1. await page.getByRole('button', { name: '提交保单' }).click()
2. await page.locator('button[type="submit"]').click()
3. await page.getByText('提交保单').click()

Recommended (most robust): Option 1
- Uses semantic role binding (survives CSS class changes)
- Language-aware (works with i18n updates)
```

### Example 3: Flaky Test Diagnosis

**Input:**
```
Diagnose why this test is flaky:
it('should load user dashboard', async () => {
  const dashboard = await page.locator('.dashboard').waitFor();
  const count = await dashboard.locator('.card').count();
  expect(count).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

**Output:**
```
Flaky Test Report:
- Flakiness probability: 87% (HIGH)
- Root cause: Race condition between page load and element appearance

Recommended fixes:
1. Replace implicit waitFor() with explicit wait:
   await expect(page.locator('.dashboard')).toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 })

2. Add network idle wait:
   await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')

3. Use data-testid for stability:
   <div data-testid="user-dashboard" className="dashboard">...</div>

4. Add retry wrapper for truly async cases:
   await expect.poll(async () => {
     return await page.locator('.card').count();
   }, { timeout: 10000 }).toBeGreaterThan(0);
```

### Example 4: Coverage triage for a legacy module

**Input:**
```
Module: premium_calculator.py, 41% coverage, 1,800 lines, no tests for 2 years.
Where do we start? We cannot stop feature work to fix this.
```

**Output:**
```
Do not "add tests until 80%". Triage instead.

Step 1 - Find the money paths (half a day)
  Grep for the entry points actually called in production:
  calculate_premium, apply_discount, validate_eligibility
  These 3 functions are ~180 lines and carry all the risk.

Step 2 - Characterisation tests first (2 days)
  Before refactoring anything, lock in current behaviour:
  - Snapshot 200 real historical inputs -> outputs into a fixture file
  - Assert the module reproduces them exactly
  This makes future refactoring safe even if today's behaviour is wrong.

Step 3 - Add rule tests only where rules are unclear (3 days)
  Boundary: age 18 / 70, health_score 0 / 100, coverage 0 / max
  Negative: non-integer age, negative coverage, None
  Error: missing rate table -> explicit exception, not silent 0

Step 4 - Exclude the noise (1 hour)
  # .coveragerc
  omit = generated/*, migrations/*, */dto/*

Step 5 - Set the gate where you actually are, then ratchet
  Start the gate at 45% (today + small margin) and raise it only when a
  pull request would otherwise pass below it. Never lower it.

Realistic outcome after 1 sprint: overall ~55%, critical-path ~90%.
The second number is the one that matters.
```

### Example 5: A test that should not be healed

**Input:**
```
This Playwright test has been auto-healed 4 times this month. Should we heal it again?
```

**Output:**
```
No. Four heals in a month is a design signal, not a maintenance event.

What the pattern tells us:
- The UI is churning faster than the test contract can follow
- There is no stable selector agreement between dev and QA
- Each heal silently moves the test further from the original intent
- At some point the test will pass while the feature is broken

Recommended sequence:
1. Freeze healing on this test; mark it @quarantined with an expiry date
2. Ask the dev team to add data-testid to the 3 elements involved
   (a 15-minute change that removes the whole problem class)
3. Re-derive the assertions from the user story, not from the current DOM
4. Add the selector contract to the definition-of-done for that component

Escalation trigger for management:
- If >20% of the suite needed healing this month, the cost is a process problem.
  One engineer adding test IDs is cheaper than an agent healing forever.

Healing budget rule of thumb: at most 2 heals per selector per quarter.
Beyond that, fix the contract.
```

## Ecosystem Status (as of 2026-09-10)

Tooling in AI-assisted QA changes quickly. Verify each item against the
project's official releases before relying on it.

| Area | What to verify | Why it matters here |
|---|---|---|
| Browser automation baseline | Current Playwright / Cypress / Selenium major versions | Selector APIs and auto-waiting behaviour differ by version |
| Visual AI / self-healing vendors | Whether the healing engine is self-hosted or SaaS | SaaS means screenshots leave your network — a blocker for regulated data |
| CI log retention | How long your CI keeps test history | Flakiness detection needs ≥ 30 runs; short retention kills the signal |
| Coverage format stability | JSON/XML schema of your coverage tool | Parser breaks silently on major upgrades |
| AI-generated test review policy | Your org's rule on merging generated tests | Determines the human checkpoint that must exist |

**Recent dynamics (as of 2026-09-10, verify against official sources)**
1. Self-healing and visual-AI testing have become common features rather than
   differentiators, which shifts the buyer question from "does it heal" to
   "can I audit what it healed and why".
2. More teams are treating test-suite health as a production signal: flaky-test
   quarantine budgets and mutation scores are appearing alongside coverage gates.
3. Data-residency concerns are pushing some regulated teams away from
   SaaS-based visual testing toward self-hosted snapshot comparison.
4. Every version number and tool name above is point-in-time; confirm upstream.

## Best Practices

1. **Always add `data-testid` attributes** to UI elements for stable selectors
2. **Use explicit waits** instead of `sleep()` — AI will recommend optimal wait strategies
3. **Keep tests isolated** — each test should be independent
4. **Parameterize test data** — use data-driven tests for variant coverage
5. **Review self-healed selectors** — AI suggestions should be human-verified before production

## Notes

- This skill produces test code, analysis and configuration for you to run in your own environment; the code blocks in this document are reference material, not commands this skill executes on your behalf
- For CI/CD integration, combine with `ai-test-strategy-architect` skill
- Self-healing suggestions prioritize semantic selectors over CSS class selectors
- Coverage analysis requires access to test execution output files (JSON/XML format)
