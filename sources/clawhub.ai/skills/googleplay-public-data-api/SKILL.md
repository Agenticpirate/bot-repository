# Google Play Public Data API Skill

Use ReplyNodes' production Google Play API to retrieve public Android app data as normalized JSON. The API is read-only: it does not authenticate as a Google user, publish apps, modify listings, or expose credentials.

## Setup

1. Create a free ReplyNodes account at https://app.replynodes.com/auth.
2. The free plan includes 500 one-time credits; no payment setup is required.
3. Open https://app.replynodes.com/developers and create the single long-lived ReplyNodes fetcher API key.
4. Store it as `REPLYNODES_API_KEY` in an agent secret store; never paste it into chat, commit it, or put it in a URL.
5. Send it as `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FETCHER_KEY`.

Gateway: `https://api.replynodes.com`

## When to Use

Use when an agent needs to:
- find Android apps by search term;
- inspect app metadata, permissions, reviews, data safety, availability, or similar apps;
- list categories or apps in a category;
- inspect apps by developer or query suggestions.

Do not use this skill for app publishing, account access, private Google Play data, catalog/sitemap enumeration, or write operations.

## Prerequisites

- A ReplyNodes fetcher API key with prepaid credits (see Setup above).
- Store the key in an environment variable such as `REPLYNODES_API_KEY`; never put it in prompts, source files, URLs, logs, or HTML reports.
- Production base URL: `https://api.replynodes.com`.

Standard Google Play app-data requests cost `1 prepaid_credit` per request, unless `GET /v1/googleplay/capabilities` advertises a different configured cost for that operation. Confirm the response contains normalized `data` before treating it as a successful read.

## Quick Reference

All routes are `GET` and require `Authorization: Bearer $REPLYNODES_API_KEY`:

| Operation | Route |
|---|---|
| app details | `/v1/googleplay/app_details/{id}` |
| search | `/v1/googleplay/search?term={term}` |
| similar apps | `/v1/googleplay/similar_apps/{id}` |
| permissions | `/v1/googleplay/permissions/{id}` |
| reviews | `/v1/googleplay/reviews/{id}` |
| developer apps | `/v1/googleplay/developer?dev_id={id}` |
| categories | `/v1/googleplay/categories` |
| category apps | `/v1/googleplay/category_apps/{category}` |
| suggestions | `/v1/googleplay/suggest?term={term}` |
| availability | `/v1/googleplay/availability/{id}` |
| data safety | `/v1/googleplay/data_safety/{id}` |

Use `GET /v1/googleplay/capabilities` to confirm the currently advertised operation matrix and prepaid credit costs before a batch.

## How to Run

Use the `terminal` tool with an environment variable and URL-encoded query parameters. Example:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body --silent --show-error \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLYNODES_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  "https://api.replynodes.com/v1/googleplay/app_details/com.google.android.youtube?country=us&language=en"
```

Search and suggestions use `term`; list-like operations accept bounded `limit` values. Common locale parameters are `country` and `language`. Reviews may accept `limit`, `sort`, `score`, and `next_token`. Availability accepts a bounded comma-separated `countries` list.

## Procedure

1. Call `/v1/googleplay/capabilities` and confirm the operation is listed, `read_only` is true, and the prepaid credit cost is as expected (1 `prepaid_credit` per request unless otherwise advertised).
2. Validate the package ID, developer ID, category, and query locally; URL-encode query parameters with the `terminal` tool rather than concatenating untrusted strings into shell commands.
3. Send one `GET` request with the ReplyNodes Bearer key (`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FETCHER_KEY`). Never send a Google credential, cookie, OAuth token, or session.
4. On HTTP 200, parse the normalized `data` and preserve `meta.request_id` for debugging. Treat null fields as unknown, not as zero or false.
5. On HTTP 401, stop — the `REPLYNODES_API_KEY` is missing or invalid. Fix the `Authorization` header before retrying; do not retry blindly.
6. On HTTP 400, fix the input. On provider errors (5xx) or timeouts, report the error and request ID without fabricating data — this is a provider failure, not a payment failure.
7. For reviews, keep the returned `sort` unchanged while following `next_token`, and impose a caller-side maximum page count.
8. For availability, keep country input bounded. Do not use this route to enumerate the full catalog.

## Response Handling

Successful responses use a normalized envelope with `data` and `meta.request_id`. App-like results use stable `googleplay:app:<package-id>` identifiers. Search, similar, developer, and category results are arrays. Permissions and suggestions are arrays. Availability and data safety are structured objects. Unknown upstream fields are intentionally omitted.

## Pitfalls

- A capabilities response proves discovery, not a successful data read that consumed a credit.
- A 401 response means a missing or invalid API key; it is not an upstream outage.
- A provider failure (5xx, timeout) is not a payment failure — do not conflate the two or assume credits were charged.
- Do not confuse `country`/`language` with Google account authentication; this API reads public store data.
- Do not expose API keys in copied curl commands, reports, screenshots, or chat; never paste `REPLYNODES_API_KEY` into chat, commit it, or put it in a URL.
- Do not assume all upstream library methods are public ReplyNodes routes; only the eleven routes listed by capabilities are supported.
- Provider results can change over time; retain the request ID and capture time when evidence matters.

## Verification

A successful run is verified when:
- capabilities lists the requested operation, marks the provider read-only, and reports the expected `prepaid_credit` cost;
- the request returns HTTP 200 through `api.replynodes.com` (a 401 means `REPLYNODES_API_KEY` is missing or invalid, not that credits ran out);
- the response contains normalized `data` plus `meta.request_id`;
- the output contains no authorization header or secret material;
- every pagination loop has a caller-side page limit.
