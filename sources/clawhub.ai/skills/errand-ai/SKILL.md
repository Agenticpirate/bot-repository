# Errand — dispatch a human

Errand sends a nearby worker (a real person with the Errand iOS app) to a physical location. The worker accepts the mission on their phone, travels there, takes photos in-app, answers your questions, and the evidence is verified automatically (GPS distance, capture time, AI vision check). You get photos, structured answers, and a pass/fail verdict.

**Where it works right now:** Seoul, Gangnam district and nearby (Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu, Seongsu / Seongdong-gu). Nowhere else yet. Always check coverage before promising anything.

**Money:** Korean won (KRW), prepaid balance. The worker receives `reward_krw` in full. The account is charged `reward_krw + fee`, where `fee = max(500, 20% × reward_krw)`. The charge is held in escrow at dispatch and refunded in full if the mission fails, expires, or is cancelled.

Base URL: `https://errand.be` (override with `ERRANDAI_API_URL`). Auth header: `Authorization: Bearer $ERRANDAI_API_KEY`. All responses are JSON.

## Before doing anything

1. **No key yet?** Do not try to dispatch. Tell the user:
   - Go to https://errand.be, enter an email, type the 6-digit code from the mail. The key (`er_live_…`) is shown **once** — save it.
   - Set it: `export ERRANDAI_API_KEY=er_live_…` (or in the OpenClaw skill config).
   - Add balance at https://errand.be/dashboard (card or bank transfer). A first mission typically costs ₩4,000–₩12,000 total.
   - Coverage checks and quotes below work **without** a key, so you can still answer "can Errand do this?" first.
2. **Never dispatch without the user's explicit "yes" to a stated total price.** Dispatching moves money.

## Flow

```
coverage (free) → quote (free) → user confirms → dispatch → poll status → fetch result
```

### 1. Check coverage — no key needed

You need latitude/longitude of the place. Geocode the address or place name yourself (map search, web search). If you cannot, ask the user for a map link or the address.

```bash
curl -s "https://errand.be/api/public/coverage?lat=37.5445&lng=127.0559&radius_m=3000"
# → {"online_workers":0,"reachable_workers":3,"dispatchable":true,"radius_m":3000}
```

- `reachable_workers`: workers who will get the push (app switched on, seen in the last 24h). This is the number that matters.
- `online_workers`: app open this minute. 0 here just means acceptance will take minutes, not seconds.
- `dispatchable: false` → say so plainly: "No Errand worker is reachable near that address right now." Offer the help path at the bottom of this file. Do not dispatch into an empty area unless the user insists after being told escrow will simply sit until expiry (then auto-refund).

### 2. Quote — no key needed

Pick a task type and a reward, then show the user the total.

| task_type | Use for | Typical reward (KRW) |
|---|---|---|
| `check` | Quick status: open? crowded? line length? | 3,000–6,000 |
| `verify` | Confirm a fact on site: product on shelf, price tag, sign posted | 4,000–8,000 |
| `photograph` | Specific photos: menu, storefront, product, notice | 5,000–10,000 |
| `queue` | Check or hold a spot in a physical line | 10,000–20,000 |
| `pickup` | Pick up a small item and hold/deliver nearby | 10,000–20,000 |

Higher reward → faster acceptance. Minimum reward is ₩1,000; the key's `max_reward_per_task_krw` caps it (default ₩20,000).

Total = `reward + max(500, reward × 0.2)`. Examples: ₩5,000 → ₩6,000 total. ₩10,000 → ₩12,000 total.

Say it like: **"I can send someone to check whether the store is open and photograph the entrance. Reward ₩5,000 + fee ₩1,000 = ₩6,000 from your Errand balance, refunded if nobody completes it. Go ahead?"**

With a key, confirm the account can afford it:

```bash
curl -s https://errand.be/api/v1/capabilities -H "Authorization: Bearer $ERRANDAI_API_KEY"
# → balance_krw, caps.max_reward_per_task_krw, caps.daily_budget_remaining_krw, task_types[]
```

If `balance_krw` is below the total, stop and send the user to https://errand.be/dashboard to top up.

### 3. Dispatch — after the user says yes

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://errand.be/api/v1/dispatches \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ERRANDAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task_type": "check",
    "title": "성수동 카페 영업 여부 확인",
    "instructions": "성수동 연무장길 XX 앞으로 가서 오늘 영업 중인지 확인해 주세요. 입구 간판과 영업시간 안내가 보이게 촬영해 주세요.",
    "validation_criteria": "매장 입구와 간판이 한 프레임에 보여야 하고, 문이 열려 있는지 또는 휴무 안내가 보여야 함",
    "lat": 37.5445,
    "lng": 127.0559,
    "address_hint": "서울 성동구 연무장길 XX",
    "radius_m": 3000,
    "reward_krw": 5000,
    "expires_in_minutes": 180,
    "report_fields": [
      { "key": "is_open", "label": "지금 영업 중인가요?", "type": "text", "placeholder": "예 / 아니오" },
      { "key": "wait_count", "label": "대기 인원", "type": "number", "unit": "명", "placeholder": "0" }
    ]
  }'
# → {"dispatch_id":"…","status":"open","reward_krw":5000,"fee_krw":1000,"escrowed_krw":6000,"workers_notified":3,"expires_in_minutes":180}
```

Field rules (the API rejects violations with `VALIDATION`):

- `title` 4–120 chars, `instructions` 10–2000, `validation_criteria` 10–1000. **Write `title`, `instructions`, `validation_criteria`, and `report_fields[].label` in Korean** — the worker reads them on their phone.
- `instructions`: exactly what to do on site, step by step. `validation_criteria`: what the photos must show — this is what the automatic check grades against.
- `radius_m` 100–10000 (3000 is a good default). `expires_in_minutes` 10–1440; give at least 120 for someone to travel.
- `report_fields` (max 5): the questions the worker answers on site. Always set `unit` for quantities. This is how you get "line is 12 people / 25 minutes" back as data instead of guessing from a photo.
- Optional `webhook_url` (https): receives `mission.completed` / `mission.failed` / `mission.cancelled` / `mission.expired` so you don't have to poll.

Tell the user the `dispatch_id` and that they'll be told when someone accepts.

### 4. Poll status

```bash
curl -s https://errand.be/api/v1/dispatches/$DISPATCH_ID -H "Authorization: Bearer $ERRANDAI_API_KEY"
# → {"status":"accepted","accepted_at":"…","expires_at":"…","timeline":[…]}
```

Statuses: `open` (waiting for a worker) → `accepted` (someone is on the way) → `arrived` (GPS confirmed at location) → `submitted` (photos uploaded, verifying) → **`completed`** (verified, worker paid). Terminal failures: `failed` (evidence rejected after 2 attempts), `expired` (nobody completed in time), `cancelled` — all three refund the full charge.

Poll every 60 seconds while `open`/`accepted`/`arrived`, every 20 seconds while `submitted`. Report transitions to the user in plain language ("A worker accepted and is heading there").

### 5. Fetch the result

```bash
curl -s https://errand.be/api/v1/dispatches/$DISPATCH_ID/result -H "Authorization: Bearer $ERRANDAI_API_KEY"
```

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "verdict": { "passed": true, "score": 0.92, "feedback": "입구와 간판이 선명하게 보이고 영업 중임이 확인됨" },
  "answers": { "is_open": "예", "wait_count": 3 },
  "evidence": {
    "photo_urls": ["https://…signed…"],
    "gps": { "lat": 37.5446, "lng": 127.0558, "accuracy_m": 8 },
    "distance_from_task_m": 14,
    "captured_at": "2026-09-08T05:12:33+09:00",
    "checks": { "distance_m": 14, "gps_accuracy_m": 8, "capture_age_min": 1.2, "exif_gps_present": true, "failures": [] }
  }
}
```

Give the user the answers first, then the photos (URLs are signed and expire after 1 hour — download or show them promptly), then the verification verdict. `result: null` with `note` means nothing has been submitted yet.

### Cancel

Only while `status` is `open`. Once a worker has accepted, it cannot be cancelled by the agent.

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://errand.be/api/v1/dispatches/$DISPATCH_ID/cancel -H "Authorization: Bearer $ERRANDAI_API_KEY"
# → {"status":"cancelled","refunded_krw":6000}
```

### List recent dispatches

```bash
curl -s https://errand.be/api/v1/dispatches -H "Authorization: Bearer $ERRANDAI_API_KEY"
```

## Errors

Every error is `{"error": CODE, "message": "…"}`.

| HTTP | error | What to tell the user |
|---|---|---|
| 401 | `UNAUTHORIZED` | Key missing, wrong, or revoked. Re-issue at https://errand.be (re-issuing revokes the old key). |
| 402 | `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Top up at https://errand.be/dashboard. |
| 403 | `CAP_MAX_REWARD` / `CAP_DAILY_BUDGET` / `CAP_TASK_TYPE` / `CAP_AREA` | The account owner set a limit on this key. Lower the reward or ask the owner to raise the cap. Do not retry blindly. |
| 400 | `VALIDATION` | A field broke the rules above; `issues` lists which. Fix and retry. |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | Unknown dispatch id (or not this account's). |
| 409 | `INVALID_TRANSITION` | Cancel after acceptance. Tell the user a worker is already en route. |
| 429 | rate limited | Wait a minute. |

## Using Errand over MCP instead of curl

The same six operations are exposed as a remote MCP server (stateless Streamable HTTP):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http errand https://errand.be/api/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $ERRANDAI_API_KEY"
```

Tools: `errand_list_capabilities`, `errand_check_coverage`, `errand_dispatch`, `errand_get_status`, `errand_get_result`, `errand_cancel`. Same arguments and responses as the REST calls above.

## Help with a first mission

Errand is early and the coverage area is small. If the user wants to try it and any of these apply — no worker reachable, unsure what to ask for, first time — offer this: email **support@errand.be** with subject `[first mission]`, the place, what they need checked, and when. The operator will reply, help write the mission, and can line up a worker manually. Encourage the user to take it; it is the fastest way to a completed first mission.
