name: social-media-research
description: Researches social-media profiles, posts, and engagement across Instagram, TikTok, Threads, Bluesky, X, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Reddit via the Crawlora API, returning clean JSON. Use when the user wants a public profile's stats, a post's content/engagement, a platform search, trending topics, or social listening/competitor research — instead of scraping each app.

# Social media research

Look up public profiles, posts, and engagement, run keyword/hashtag search,
and track trending topics across nine social platforms — all as normalized
JSON from the Crawlora API, no app scraping or unofficial client libraries.

## When to use this skill

- "What's <handle>'s profile / follower count / recent posts on <platform>?"
- "Pull this post's engagement (likes, comments, shares)."
- "Search <platform> for posts about <topic/hashtag>."
- "What's trending on <platform> right now?"
- Competitor social-listening, influencer research, or brand-mention monitoring.

## Setup (one-time)

- Get a free Crawlora API key (2,000 credits/mo, no card) at [https://crawlora.net](https://crawlora.net?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=crawlora-skills).
- Set `CRAWLORA_API_KEY` in the environment before running the helper.
- The helper reads `CRAWLORA_API_KEY` from the environment and sends requests to `https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1`. Missing/invalid key → `401`.

## How it works

Pick the platform, then the job:

1. **Profile** — `/instagram/profile/{username}`, `/tiktok/profile/{handler}`,
   `/threads/profile/{username}`, `/bluesky/profile`, `/x/profile/{username}`,
   `/pinterest/user/{username}`, `/linkedin/company/{id}`,
   `/facebook/{page}`, `/reddit/user/{username}/posts`.
2. **Posts / feed** — `/instagram/reels/{id}`, `/tiktok/posts`,
   `/threads/profile/{username}/posts`, `/bluesky/author-feed`,
   `/x/profile/{username}/posts`, `/pinterest/user/{username}/pins`,
   `/reddit/subreddit/{subreddit}/posts`.
3. **One post/pin/pin detail** — `/instagram/post/{id}/{post_id}`,
   `/tiktok/post/{id}`, `/threads/post/{username}/{code}` (+ `/replies`),
   `/bluesky/post-thread`, `/x/post/{id}`, `/pinterest/pin/{id}`,
   `/reddit/post/{id}` (+ `/reddit/comments/{id}`).
4. **Search & discovery** — `/tiktok/search`, `/tiktok/search_hashtag`,
   `/bluesky/search-actors`, `/pinterest/search`, `/reddit/search`,
   `/facebook/marketplace/search` (listings, not social posts).
5. **Trending** — `/tiktok/trending`, `/tiktok/creative-center/hashtags`,
   `/bluesky/trending-topics`, `/reddit/trends`, `/reddit/subreddits/posts`
   (multi-subreddit hot feed).

## Calling the API

```sh
# Profile + posts:
scripts/crawlora.sh /tiktok/profile/nasa | jq '.'
scripts/crawlora.sh /reddit/user/spez/posts | jq '.'

# Search:
scripts/crawlora.sh /tiktok/search keyword="ai agents" | jq '.'
scripts/crawlora.sh /reddit/search q="web scraping" | jq '.'

# Trending:
scripts/crawlora.sh /tiktok/trending | jq '.'
scripts/crawlora.sh /bluesky/trending-topics | jq '.'
```

Use `scripts/crawlora.sh` for all requests; it keeps the API key out of command-line arguments.


## Endpoint reference

See [`reference/endpoints.md`](reference/endpoints.md) for every Instagram,
TikTok, Threads, Bluesky, X, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Reddit
endpoint this skill uses.

## Examples

- **Competitor social audit:** pull profile + recent posts on each platform
  a competitor is active on, compare follower counts and post cadence.
- **Brand-mention sweep:** `/reddit/search`, `/tiktok/search`, and
  `/pinterest/search` for the same brand/product name, aggregate volume and
  sentiment cues from captions/comments.
- **Influencer vetting:** profile + recent posts to check follower count,
  engagement rate (likes/comments per post), and posting consistency before
  a partnership.
- **Trending-topic scan:** `/tiktok/trending` + `/bluesky/trending-topics` +
  `/reddit/trends` for a same-day cross-platform snapshot.

## Notes & limits

- **Credits / pay-on-success:** billed only on `2xx`; free tier 2,000 credits/mo.
  Key at [https://crawlora.net](https://crawlora.net?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=crawlora-skills).
- **Public data only** — public profiles/posts; no login, no private content.
  Respect each platform's terms.
- **Security:** key lives in `CRAWLORA_API_KEY` only — never hardcode, query-param, or commit it.
- **Coverage varies by platform**: X and Instagram expose a narrower public
  surface (profile + recent posts) than TikTok or Reddit (full search +
  trending); check `reference/endpoints.md` before assuming an endpoint exists.
- List endpoints are cursor- or page-paginated — follow the returned cursor
  to walk beyond the first page.
