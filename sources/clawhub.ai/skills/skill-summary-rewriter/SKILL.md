# Skill Storefront Copy

Turn an approved Storefront Copy Brief into storefront-ready copy without changing the underlying positioning. Keep the stable identifier `skill-summary-rewriter`.

## Scope

Use this skill when the audience, trigger, promise, differentiation, and supporting evidence are settled. If a strategy-critical field is unclear, identify the gap instead of masking it with polished wording.

Boundary: **current conversation content only / no side effects**. Return plain text.

## Evidence rules

- Apply explicit constraints from the current request.
- Use the approved brief as the strategy source.
- Support material claims with supplied evidence.
- Identify conflicts that alter audience, promise, differentiation, or evidence.

## Storefront Copy Brief intake contract

- `source_slug`
- `current_display_name`
- `audience`
- `trigger`
- `problem`
- `desired_outcome`
- `alternative`
- `why_alternative_falls_short`
- `single_promise`
- `differentiation_pillars`
- `proof`
- `must_mention`
- `must_not_claim`
- `tone`
- `placements_and_limits`
- `open_questions`

Classify intake as:

- **Complete:** all strategy-critical fields and sufficient evidence are present.
- **Conservative:** only non-critical fields are missing; state assumptions and keep wording narrow.
- **Return to Review:** audience, promise, differentiation, or evidence is missing or contradictory.

Preserve `source_slug` and `must_not_claim` exactly.

## Copy method

1. Lock strategy-level facts from the approved brief.
2. Form one outcome-led message spine: `[audience] uses it at [trigger] to achieve [outcome], distinguished by [supported differentiator].`
3. Draft three purpose-specific sets:
   - **Direct:** lowest interpretation cost, suitable for a frontmatter description.
   - **Distinctive:** emphasizes the strongest supported differentiator, suitable for first-screen copy.
   - **Compact:** preserves essential meaning under tight limits.
4. In each set, provide a display name, frontmatter description, hero heading, hero paragraph, optional CTA, and best placement.
5. Check every material claim against a brief field or supplied evidence.
6. Recommend one set and placement. Accuracy takes precedence over novelty.

## Writing constraints

- Lead with the supported user outcome, then the method.
- Name the audience or trigger when space permits.
- Keep each description focused on one promise rather than a feature list.
- Remove vague superiority claims and unsupported certainty.
- The display name may change; `source_slug` must not.
- Respect `must_mention`, `must_not_claim`, tone, placement, and length constraints.
- Preserve positioning facts.
