  Payable matching for BaconCo — reconcile vendor documents in Odoo's Documents
  app against their purchase orders and correct incorrect PO line pricing. Use
  for requests like "check the Purchasing folder against the POs and fix the
  pricing", "match the vendor invoice / order confirmation / acknowledgement to
  its PO", "AP price matching / invoice-to-PO matching / three-way match",
  "reconcile the vendor documents and mark the POs checked", or "go through the
  Purchasing folder". The flow: read every document in a Documents-app folder
  (extracting text out-of-context so large batches don't bloat the context
  window — falling back to a page render + OCR/vision for scanned or
  custom-encoded PDFs that won't extract as text), pull the PO number / line
  items / unit prices from each, compare to the purchase order line by line,
  correct any wrong `price_unit`, post a "checked" log note on the PO (internal,
  never a "Send message"), and FILE every document into the `Matched` or
  `Questions` subfolder — escalating genuine questions to a reviewer (default
  Zach Tucker). Also runs the buying-group payables flow: pull Sports Inc
  invoices from the SportsLink API (via the `sportsinc-sportslink` adapter),
  reconcile each to its PO, correct price variances, create the vendor bill and
  — when the bill total matches the invoice within tolerance — POST it, leaving
  any mismatch in draft for a human ("get the Sports Inc invoices and bill
  them", "match the SI invoices to POs and post the payables", "match the vendor
  invoice and post the bill if it matches"). Handles the multi-shipment case
  where one PO returns several Sports Inc invoices, splitting it into one vendor
  bill per shipment via `account.move.line` edits (the `ap_*_bill_line(s)`
  tools). Runs at volume on a low-cost model.
  Driven by the Odoo `drivethru_mcp` MCP server; complements the broader
  `drivethru-odoo` skill.

# Payable matching (Purchasing folder → purchase orders)

Reconcile vendor documents against their purchase orders and fix PO line
pricing. A **vendor document** is an order confirmation, shipment
acknowledgement, or invoice filed in the Documents app's **Purchasing** folder;
its authority for what BaconCo will be billed is the vendor's own numbers.

The task, per document: read it → extract the **PO number, line items, and unit
prices** → find the PO in Odoo → compare **line by line** → correct any wrong
`price_unit` → post a "checked" note on the PO → **file the document** into
`Matched` (reconciled) or `Questions` (needs a human). Nothing stays in the
inbox.

This changes live financial data (PO prices, chatter, activities). The
standing request *"review the Purchasing folder and fix the pricing"*
authorizes the corrections and the "checked" notes; still, **only correct a
line when the vendor document unambiguously supports it** — when in doubt, route
it to Questions rather than guessing.

## Always use Log note, never Send message

Every annotation you leave on a PO or a document — the "checked" note, a
partial-shipment note, a question, any comment — MUST be an internal **Log
note**, never a **Send message**. In Odoo chatter, "Send message" notifies the
record's followers and can **email the vendor or customer**; a Log note stays
internal. These vendor documents are BaconCo's own AP working notes — nothing
here should ever leave Odoo as an email.

The helper's `matched` / `questions` commands and the `po_post_message` /
`documents_post_message` MCP tools post internal **log notes** — use them. Do
**not** reach for any "send message", email, or notify-followers path when
annotating a PO or document, and if a tool ever exposes a note-vs-message
choice, always choose the internal note.

## How you reach Odoo (runtime-aware — read this first)

This skill drives the same Odoo **`drivethru_mcp`** MCP as `drivethru-odoo`, and
`ODOO_MCP_URL` / `ODOO_MCP_TOKEN` are already configured. **Never say you "can't
reach Odoo" or "don't have the tools in this thread" and guess instead — call a
tool, or state the exact call you tried and the error you got.**

- **Native / callable MCP tools (preferred, no shell needed).** If the Odoo
  tools are attached to you natively, **call them directly** — e.g.
  `documents_list_folders {"name": "Purchasing"}`, whose `document_count` is how
  many documents are waiting to be matched. They may be **deferred** — if your
  runtime lazy-loads tools, search your tools for `documents_search`,
  `ap_search_purchase_orders`, `ap_update_po_lines`, `po_post_message`,
  `po_get_messages`, etc. and load them before calling. "I don't see them yet"
  is not "I don't have them."
- **Shell (`scripts/paymatch.py`) — only if you have a shell.** The helper below
  is a context-economy optimization (bulk PDF text extraction, one call per
  folder); prefer it for large batches when a shell is available.
- **Not connected at all?** Attaching the `drivethru_mcp` MCP natively — or
  giving the agent a shell — is an **operator step**; env vars alone don't
  attach the tools. See `drivethru-odoo`'s **Operator setup** and
  **Troubleshooting** sections before concluding you can't reach Odoo.

## The engine: `scripts/paymatch.py` (keep the work out of context)

Reading PDFs is the expensive part. `documents_get` returns each file as
**base64**, and a multimodal PDF reader adds a **page image** — both dwarf the
few hundred characters of text that matter. Do that per file across a folder,
many times a day, and the context window fills with bytes and renders (and the
token bill balloons). So **never loop `documents_get`/a PDF reader over the
folder.** Use the helper, which does the heavy, deterministic work locally and
returns only what the model needs.

```bash
# 1. Read the whole folder as TEXT (no base64, no render) — ONE call
python3 scripts/paymatch.py extract '{"folder": "Purchasing"}'

# 1b. Any document flagged needs_vision (scanned or custom-encoded) → render its
#     page(s) to PNG (+ OCR if tesseract is present), then read the image(s)
python3 scripts/paymatch.py render '{"document_id": 485}'

# 2. Per document: pull the PO trimmed to matchable fields (incl. qty_received)
python3 scripts/paymatch.py po-lines '{"po": "P13189"}'

# 2b. Partial shipment? Read the PO's prior log notes to see what's already checked
python3 scripts/paymatch.py notes '{"po": "P13137"}'

# 3. Correct any wrong line(s) in one call (PO must be confirmed)
python3 scripts/paymatch.py apply '{"po_id": 13145, "lines": [{"line_id": 40941, "price_unit": 11.94}]}'

# 4a. Clean/fixed → post the checked LOG NOTE AND file to Matched (one call)
python3 scripts/paymatch.py matched '{"po_id": 13145, "document_id": 481, "body": "Pricing checked against SanMar Order Confirmation ... corrected size S $13.94→$11.94."}'

# 4b. Genuine question → raise a reviewer activity AND file to Questions (one call)
python3 scripts/paymatch.py questions '{"document_id": 485, "question": "Totals don't reconcile — please review.", "reviewer": "Zach Tucker"}'
```

Every command prints one JSON object, or `{"error": {...}}` with a non-zero
exit. Requires `ODOO_MCP_URL` / `ODOO_MCP_TOKEN` (if missing, the script exits
with `config_error` — stop and tell the user to configure them; never ask for
the key in chat).

**Dependencies self-install.** The script's deps (`mcp`, `pymupdf`, `pypdf`)
are declared in the frontmatter `install.uv`, but not every OpenClaw host honors
it — so `scripts/_bootstrap.py` ensures them at startup: on a missing import it
builds a cached `uv` venv (in `$PAYMATCH_DATA_DIR` or `~/.drivethru/paymatch`)
and re-execs. Hosts that pre-install make it a no-op; otherwise the **first run
pays a one-time install**, then it's cached. So a `ModuleNotFoundError` (e.g.
`No module named 'anyio'`) is not a dead end — it self-heals on the next run, as
long as **`uv` is on PATH**. If the script exits saying `uv` is missing, that's
an operator step (install `uv`, or the host must honor `install.uv`); fall back
to the native `documents_*` / `ap_*` / `po_*` MCP tools in the meantime.

If you have **no shell** (e.g. a chat agent), use the native `documents_*` /
`ap_*` / `po_*` MCP tools directly — they do everything the script does; the
script is only a context-economy wrapper for bulk PDF extraction. Working
natively, still fetch **one document at a time** and drop the base64 — never
pull a whole folder's bytes into context. (If creds are unset or the MCP isn't
attached, see `drivethru-odoo`'s Troubleshooting — don't guess.)

## Procedure

1. **Read the folder once.** `paymatch.py extract '{"folder": "Purchasing"}'`
   → `documents[]` with `document_id`, `name`, and extracted `text`. Work from
   that text. Extraction runs PyMuPDF → `pdftotext` → `pypdf` and **quality-gates
   the result**, so a document flagged `needs_vision: true` is one no text pass
   could read reliably — either scanned/image-only, OR a **custom-encoded PDF**
   (Type3 / no usable ToUnicode — e.g. some Charles River Apparel shipment
   confirmations) that renders perfectly but extracts as empty/garbage.
   **Do not escalate a `needs_vision` document as "unreadable" — read it.**
   Run `paymatch.py render '{"document_id": <id>}'` to rasterise its page(s) to
   PNG (plus OCR text when `tesseract` is installed), then read the image(s)
   with vision to pull the PO number and line items and match as normal. (No
   shell? Fetch with `documents_get {"document_id"}` and read the bytes with a
   vision reader — same idea.) The old failure mode — "couldn't get a reliable
   PO number from unattended extraction, please review manually" — is exactly
   this case, and the render/vision fallback resolves it instead of punting.

2. **Extract from each document's text (not its filename).** The PO number is
   **inside** the document; a filename may show the vendor's order number
   instead (e.g. `Order Acknowledgement 48482500.pdf` whose real PO is
   `P13183`). Capture item/style, color, size, quantity, and **unit price** per
   line.

3. **Pull the PO.** `paymatch.py po-lines '{"po": "<PO#>"}'` → the PO trimmed to
   `{po_id, name, vendor, partner_ref, state, amount_untaxed, freight_cost,
   fees_cost, lines:[{line_id, sku, style, description, qty, price_unit}]}`.
   Confirm the vendor / `partner_ref` line up with the document. The PO must be
   `state: "purchase"` to edit lines. (`found: false` with `candidates` means
   the PO# didn't resolve — that's a Questions case.)

4. **Compare line by line.** Pair each document line to a PO line by **(style/
   item, color, size)** — never by row order. Size upcharges are normal (base
   sizes one price; 2XL/3XL/4XL higher) — that's correct pricing, not an error.

5. **Correct mismatches** in one call:
   `paymatch.py apply '{"po_id", "lines":[{"line_id","price_unit"}]}'`. Set
   `freight_cost`/`fees_cost` only when the **document itself** gives an
   authoritative figure — a pre-existing freight estimate or partner fee the
   document doesn't itemize is not a line error; note it for the invoice match.

6. **File the document — always.**
   - **Reconciled** (matched, or corrected with confidence) →
     `paymatch.py matched '{"po_id", "document_id", "body": "<what you checked/fixed>"}'`
     (posts the checked note + moves the doc to `Matched`).
   - **Genuine question** →
     `paymatch.py questions '{"document_id", "question": "<what to resolve>", "reviewer": "Zach Tucker"}'`
     (raises the activity + moves the doc to `Questions`). Pass `po_id` +
     `po_note` too if the PO also warrants a note.

## Totals are a cross-check, not the source of truth

A shipment acknowledgement is often **one box of a multi-shipment order**: it
covers a subset of the PO's lines, so its total is legitimately **less** than
the PO total — the rest ships later. Match on lines; a total gap fully explained
by un-shipped lines is **not** a discrepancy. Say so in the checked note so a
human isn't confused by the header total.

## Partial shipments: track cumulative coverage and call the last one

When a document is a **partial shipment** (it reconciles cleanly but covers only
some of the PO's lines), do two things before you file it:

1. **Name the lines this shipment covers.** In the `matched` log note, list the
   specific lines / SKUs this acknowledgement checks (e.g. *"Shipment of P13137
   — checked lines 3,4,7,9,10,11 (styles …), all $1.79 and matching"*). That is
   what turns the PO's chatter into a running ledger of what has been checked.

2. **Look back before you post, and call the final shipment.** Read the PO's
   prior log notes with `paymatch.py notes '{"po": "P13137"}'` (or the
   `po_get_messages` tool) and cross-check `qty_received` / `qty` per line from
   `po-lines`. If the lines you just checked, **unioned with the lines earlier
   notes already checked, now cover every line on the PO** (nothing left on
   back-order / un-received), then this is the last piece — **say so explicitly
   in the note**, e.g. *"✅ Final shipment — all 11 lines on P13137 are now fully
   checked across all shipments; PO complete."* If lines still remain, state
   which ones are still outstanding instead of implying completion.

Only claim "fully checked" when the prior log notes (and `qty_received`) actually
show the rest was checked — those notes are the evidence, which is exactly why
every annotation is an internal log note that accumulates on the PO.

## When to escalate (Questions) vs. just fix (Matched)

Escalate only a **real** ambiguity: can't read the PO#, the PO doesn't resolve,
prices don't reconcile, unexpected/missing lines, or the wrong vendor. An
unambiguous correction the vendor document plainly supports (a size priced $2
off the vendor's own confirmation) is a **Matched** fix — applying it is exactly
what the task asks. Don't manufacture a question where the document is clear;
don't guess where it isn't.

## Report

Per document: PO number, lines changed (old → new) or "no change", whether the
checked note was posted, and Matched vs Questions (and why). End with a folder
tally so the inbox state is obvious.

## Creating and posting the payable, and buying-group sources

The same reconcile-then-file loop extends to **creating the vendor bill** once a
PO's pricing is reconciled, and then **posting it when it matches**:

```bash
# Create the DRAFT bill from a reconciled PO
python3 scripts/paymatch.py bill '{"po_id": 13145, "vendor_bill_number": "<inv#>", "invoice_date": "2026-07-22", "expected_total": 1041.90, "tolerance": 0.02, "reviewer_user_id": 6, "review_note": "..."}'

# Post it — ONLY when the bill total matches the vendor invoice
python3 scripts/paymatch.py post '{"bill_id": 8842, "expected_total": 1041.90, "tolerance": 0.02, "note": "Matched to <inv#>; totals reconcile."}'
```

`bill` creates the bill in **draft** and schedules a review activity. Then
`post` performs the **match & post** step through the guarded
`ap_post_vendor_bill` tool:

- **Post only what matches.** `expected_total` (the vendor invoice total) is
  **required** for `post`, and the tool **refuses to post** a bill whose total
  deviates beyond `tolerance` (an **absolute currency amount** — e.g. `0.02` is
  two cents, not 2%). A mismatch comes back as an error and the bill stays in
  draft — **route it to a human, never post it.** This is the whole safety
  contract: a vendor bill only posts when its numbers reconcile to the invoice.
- **It's live and hard to reverse.** Posting writes the bill to the ledger
  (unposting needs a reversing entry). Only post a bill you created from a PO
  you reconciled in this same run, for an invoice whose total you verified.
  Anything ambiguous — wrong total, wrong vendor, unexpected lines, a PO that
  didn't fully reconcile — is a **Questions** escalation, not a post.
- **Dry-run first if unsure.** Pass `"post": false` to preview: it returns
  `would_post` + `total_check` (expected vs actual vs tolerance) and posts
  nothing, so you can confirm the match before committing.
- **Idempotent + audited.** Re-posting an already-posted bill is a safe no-op
  (`already_posted: true`); each post leaves an internal **log note** on the
  bill (never a "Send message", so nothing is emailed to the vendor).

Posting is **opt-in per run**: if the task is only "create the payables" or a
human wants to review before posting, stop at `bill` (draft) and skip `post`.

### Sports Inc (buying group — no per-invoice documents)

Sports Inc doesn't email individual invoices; they live in the **SportsLink
API**. The `sportsinc-sportslink` adapter pulls them (normalised to the same
invoice shape a PDF would give) and marks them consumed. The end-to-end loop —
pull active SI invoices → reconcile to the PO → **auto-fix price variances,
escalate quantity/line variances** → create the bill → **post it when the total
matches (`expected_total`), else leave it in draft for a human** → **mark the SI
doc consumed only after the bill exists** (exactly-once) — plus credit/scanned
handling and the SI-fee/`expected_total` nuance, is the dedicated procedure in
[`references/sportsinc_payables.md`](references/sportsinc_payables.md). Read it
before running the SI payables flow.

**One PO, several invoices (multi-shipment).** When a PO shipped in several
boxes, Sports Inc returns **several documents for one PO number** — each with its
own lines, freight, and `si_upcharge`. That PO bills as **one vendor bill per
document**: create the draft, then carve it to each shipment with the
`account.move.line` tools (`ap_get_vendor_bill` to see the lines, then
`ap_delete_bill_lines` / `ap_update_bill_lines` / `ap_create_bill_line` to make
each bill equal exactly one document), and post each at its own `docTotal`.
Create **one bill per SI document but post only the ones the PO's quantities
support**: a document the PO can't cover (an **over-invoice** — e.g. the vendor
invoiced replacements for units it never originally shipped, after earlier bills
consumed the PO's whole quantity) still becomes a bill via `ap_create_draft_bill`
— built off the payload's product ids and left in **draft with a review
activity**, never posted. **Skip** a PO whose SI documents lack line-level
detail. The full carve procedure — and the `min_tracking_count` search filter
that surfaces these POs — is in `references/sportsinc_payables.md` →
*Multiple invoices for one PO*.

Scope note: this skill reconciles, drafts, and — when the numbers match —
**posts**. A bill only posts when its total reconciles to the vendor invoice
within tolerance; anything that doesn't match stays in draft and goes to a
human. Only create/post bills when the task is payables (folder pricing review
alone stops at the "checked" note + filing), and stop at the draft (`bill`,
skip `post`) whenever the task is "create the payables" or a human wants to
review before posting.

#### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Mode for Sports Inc

For deployments with a **dedicated Sports Inc agent**, this agent can fetch the
invoices by *delegating* to that agent over A2A instead of running
`sportsinc-sportslink` itself. **This** agent owns `SPORTSINC_API_KEY` (it
represents your company) and *shares* it with the Sports Inc agent for the
duration of each delegated call. The A2A call is orchestrated by **you (the
agent) using the platform MCP tools** — there is no Python helper for it.

**Setup (platform console):**

1. **Create the Sports Inc agent** and install the `sportsinc-sportslink` skill.
   Do **not** bind `SPORTSINC_API_KEY` to it — the key lives on this agent.
2. **Bind `SPORTSINC_API_KEY` to this agent** (the caller) on its Credentials tab.
3. **Bind a delegation connection**: caller = this agent, target = the Sports Inc
   agent, with a label/instructions describing when to use it.
4. **Share the credential** on that connection: on this agent's Connections tab,
   under the Sports Inc connection, check `SPORTSINC_API_KEY` in "Credentials to
   share with this connection". Nothing is shared unless you check it.

**A2A call flow (agent-executed MCP tools):**

1. `get_my_bundle()` → its `structuredContent.connections[]` lists your bound
   agents; each entry is `{ targetAgentUid, displayName, label, instructions }`.
   Pick the Sports Inc one (match on `displayName`/`label`).
2. `start_agent_conversation({ agent_uid: <targetAgentUid> })` → returns a
   `conversation_id`.
3. `send_message({ conversation_id, content })` where `content` is the JSON
   request for the Sports Inc agent, e.g. `{"action": "get-for-a2a", "params":
   {"include_historical": false}}`. The reply is the `get-for-a2a` envelope
   (`{success, invoices, metadata, error}`) — on `success:false`, read
   `error.retriable` to decide retry vs. escalate.

**Async-task delegation (what the multi-invoice routine uses).** When you
delegate the lookup as a **task** (`start_task`) rather than a synchronous
`send_message`, the Sports Inc agent replies in its task **summary**, which is
**size-capped (~20k chars)** — a raw JSON dump of several POs overflows it and
is silently truncated, handing you a half-parsed payload. So **ask for a compact
markdown breakdown, not JSON**: one section per PO, each SI document with its
`si_doc_number`, `invoice_number`, `invoice_date`, `due_date`, `is_credit`,
`has_lines`, the money (`merchandise`, `freight`, `si_upcharge`, `total`), and a
terse line per item (`item`, `upc`, `size`, `qty_shipped`, `net_price`,
`extension`, `description`). Markdown carries all the same data — you don't need
strict JSON. If the reply looks cut off or is flagged truncated, treat it as
**incomplete** and re-request (or fewer POs at a time) rather than billing a
partial payload.

Then continue the normal reconciliation/draft-bill loop with the returned
`invoices` (same normalised shape as `sportslink.py list`).

**How the handoff works (pull/broker):**

- The delegation binding is the allowlist — only bound agents are reachable, and
  the call chain is depth-limited (max 5) against loops.
- The shared credential is **pulled on demand, not pushed**. When the Sports Inc
  agent handles the delegated call, its runtime calls
  `get_delegated_credentials({ conversation_id })`. The platform verifies it is
  the target of that delegated conversation and that the connection shares the
  credential, **logs the access** in `agent_connection_audit_log`, and returns a
  `{ env_key: value }` map. The runtime exposes it as env for the turn, so the
  Sports Inc agent's `sportsinc-sportslink` skill reads `SPORTSINC_API_KEY`
  normally. The secret only moves when the target actually asks for it, and every
  access is audited — nothing is provisioned permanently onto the Sports Inc agent.
