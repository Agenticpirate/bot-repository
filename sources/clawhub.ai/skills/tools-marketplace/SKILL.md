# Danube — Governed Tool Access for Agents

Danube makes an organization's own tools — plus a large and growing catalog of ready-made services — callable by AI agents through a single API key, with permissions, spending limits, and an audit trail handled by the platform. The catalog changes constantly and includes tools the user's organization connected privately, so **never assume what is available — search first.**

## Guardrails (read these first)

- **Read freely, act with consent.** Discovery — listing services, searching tools, reading schemas, checking ratings, balances, or limits — needs no confirmation. Before any action that **writes, sends, posts, deletes, purchases, spends wallet funds, stores a credential, changes spending limits, or creates/updates/deletes a skill or workflow** — and before **any batch execution** — show the user the exact tool and parameters and get an explicit "yes".
- **Honour the confirmation handshake.** If `execute_tool` comes back with `_meta.confirmation_required: true`, the account's key requires consent for destructive calls: show the user the tool and the exact `parameters` from the response, get an explicit yes, then call again with the same parameters and the `confirm_token` (valid 5 minutes). Never call again with the token without asking.
- **Never invent credentials.** Only store an API key the user has explicitly handed you in this conversation, and confirm before storing. Otherwise send them to https://danubeai.com/dashboard to connect the service themselves.
- **Least data.** Pass only the parameters the task needs; don't forward unrelated personal data to third-party services.
- **Respect limits.** Don't raise spending limits or fund wallets unless the user asks for exactly that.
- **Report specifics.** After executing, say which tool ran, with what inputs, and what came back — not just "done".

## Setup

### 1. Get an API key

From the dashboard: https://danubeai.com/dashboard → Settings → API Keys. Keys are opaque ~43-character tokens with **no fixed prefix** — don't validate their shape, just keep them secret.

Or let the user authorize this agent with the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization flow (RFC 8628):

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.danubeai.com/v1/auth/device/code \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"client_name": "OpenClaw"}'
# → {"device_code": "...", "user_code": "XXXX-XXXX", "verification_url": "...", "expires_in": ..., "interval": 5}
```

Tell the user to open `verification_url` in a browser and enter `user_code`. Then poll:

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.danubeai.com/v1/auth/device/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"device_code": "DEVICE_CODE_FROM_ABOVE"}'
```

`428` = not approved yet (poll every `interval` seconds) · `200` = `{"api_key": "…"}` · `410` = expired, start over.

### 2. Make the key available to OpenClaw

Set `DANUBE_API_KEY` in the environment, or in `openclaw.json`:

```json5
{ skills: { entries: { danube: { apiKey: "YOUR_DANUBE_API_KEY" } } } }
```

### 3a. Connect natively over MCP (recommended)

OpenClaw has a built-in MCP client. Register Danube's server once and its tools become ordinary OpenClaw tools (`search_tools`, `execute_tool`, …):

```bash
openclaw mcp set danube '{"url":"https://mcp.danubeai.com/mcp","transport":"streamable-http","headers":{"danube-api-key":"YOUR_DANUBE_API_KEY"}}'
openclaw mcp doctor danube --probe
```

Use the real key value in `headers` (not `${DANUBE_API_KEY}`). The server also speaks MCP OAuth: use `"auth":"oauth"` instead of `headers`, then `openclaw mcp login danube`.

To keep the tool list small, append `?tools=core` to the URL, or a comma list such as
`?tools=core,workflows`; without it all 31 tools are described to the model. The five groups are
`core` (10 — discovery, execution, credentials, and `report_tool`), `workflows` (6), `wallet` (6),
`skills` (5) and `feedback` (4 — `submit_rating`, `get_my_rating`, `get_tool_ratings`,
`get_recommendations`). `core` is added to whatever you ask for, so search and execute can't be
filtered out by accident. Unrecognised names are dropped silently: a typo alongside a valid group
just gives you fewer tools than you asked for, and if *none* of the names is a real group the
parameter is ignored altogether and you get the full list. Either way it fails quietly, never with
an error.

### 3b. Or use plain `curl` — no MCP needed

Every capability below is also a REST call against `https://api.danubeai.com/v1` with the header `danube-api-key: $DANUBE_API_KEY`. Copy-paste recipes: `{baseDir}/references/rest-api.md`.

## Working with tools

Every task follows **Explore → Inspect → (Confirm) → Execute → Report.**

| Goal | MCP tool | REST |
|---|---|---|
| See what services exist | `list_services(query, limit)` | `GET /services` |
| Find a tool for a task | `search_tools(query, service_id?, limit?)` | `GET /tools/search?query=…` |
| All tools of one service | `get_service_tools(service_id)` | `GET /services/{id}/tools` |
| Full schema of one tool | returned by the calls above | `GET /tools/{tool_id}` |
| Run a tool | `execute_tool(tool_id, parameters, fields?)` | `POST /tools/call/{tool_id}` with `{"tool_input": {…}}` |
| Run up to 10 at once | `batch_execute_tools(calls)` | `POST /tools/call/batch` |
| Inspect one tool before first use | `describe_tool(tool_id)` | `GET /tools/{tool_id}/describe` |
| Read a stored result back | `fetch_result(execution_id, path?)` | `GET /tools/executions/{execution_id}/result?path=…` |
| Remember a per-service default | `set_parameter_defaults(service_id, defaults)` | `PUT /services/{service_id}/parameter-defaults` |

### Reading what comes back

`execute_tool` returns `{result, _meta}` once a call actually reaches a tool. When the tool
returned JSON, the already-parsed object is at **`result.data`** — read that;
`result.content[0].text` is the transport envelope and only exists for MCP clients that
read it, so don't `json.loads()` your way down to the same thing. Don't index `_meta`
blindly: it is absent when the lookup itself failed (no `tool_id` or `tool_name` given, or
neither resolves).

Oversized payloads are trimmed. A JSON array is trimmed at element boundaries, so it stays
parseable; plain text is cut mid-string with an inline `... [truncated - response was N
chars, …]` note; and a JSON object with no array big enough to trim degrades to
`{"_truncated_partial_json": "<prefix>", "_truncated": true}` — valid JSON, but the
object's own keys are gone, so re-request it rather than parsing that. Check
`_meta.truncated`, and `_meta.truncation_note` for what went. To get the rest, raise
`max_response_chars` (default 50000, hard max 500000) or follow `_meta.cursor` when the
upstream paginates. When a tool is resolved by *name*, a publisher's lower per-tool default
can apply, so trimming below 50000 is normal there. Truncated ≠ broken — don't
`report_tool` it.

**Credential values are masked before you ever see them.** Every tool response passes
through Danube's redactor on the way out, and unless the tool is one specifically declared
as returning a credential (see below), anything that reads as a secret — API keys, tokens,
passwords, connection strings — comes back as `[REDACTED:<FIELD>]`. That is
platform policy, not a broken tool: don't `report_tool` it, and don't ask the tool to
return the raw value. When there is something to report, the redaction object carries an
exact `count` plus a `fields` list — the first 50 masked values, each with its `path`,
`key`, and the `rule` that caught it — and a `mode`. It lives at `_meta.redaction` over
MCP, where the key is absent when nothing was masked, and at top-level `redaction` over
REST, where the key is always present and simply `null`. Either way, test the value, not
the key. Pagination cursors and identifiers are exempt by name, so paging keeps working.

A tool whose whole *purpose* is to mint a credential is not redacted into uselessness.
Where Danube can, it captures the secret for you: the new value is stored as the user's
credential for the target service and `_meta.redaction.stored_credentials` says where it
landed, so the service's later calls pick it up through ordinary credential injection and
you never hold the value.

**Where it can't, the secret reaches you raw** — a tool marked as returning a credential
with no capture mapping, a self-hosted deployment (custody stays in the customer's own
environment), or a store that failed. These come back completely unmasked with
`_meta.redaction.passthrough_reason` explaining why, alongside `count: 0`. This is
not limited to short-lived handoff tokens like a Plaid *link* token: a Plaid **access**
token, a rotated webhook signing secret, and other durable secrets pass through this way.
Treat anything that arrives unmasked as a live secret — show the user where to put it,
don't echo it back, and don't paste it into a later call's parameters.

Discovery tips:
- Every search result carries `readiness`: `ready` means you can execute it now, `needs_credential` means the service needs a credential this account has not connected (send the user to `configuration_url`), `unavailable` means the service is retired. Ready tools are listed first; prefer a ready tool over a better-named one that needs setup.
- Every result also carries `deprecated`, `deprecation_message` and `sunset_date`. A deprecated tool is still listed and still runs while its sunset date is absent or in the future — that is an advance warning, and the message usually names what to use instead, so read it and switch rather than reporting the tool. Once the date has passed the tool disappears from search altogether, and `execute_tool` refuses it before calling anything — the message reads "… was deprecated and passed its sunset date (DATE): … No call was made." Match on that text: over REST the body also carries `error_type: "TOOL_SUNSET"`, but the MCP layer doesn't pass that field through on this error, so the message is the only signal you get there. Search again for the replacement; nothing about it is retryable.
- Describe the *outcome* in natural language (`"send an email"`, `"create a GitHub issue"`, `"translate text"`); search is semantic.
- **But when you already know a tool's exact name, search for exactly that.** A tool whose name or slug matches the query exactly is pinned first, ahead of the readiness and reliability re-orderings, so `results[0]` is the tool you named. Every result now carries a `slug` (`stripe-api-read`) beside its id, and a slug is accepted anywhere a tool id is — `execute_tool`, `describe_tool`, `GET /tools/{id}`. Prefer it when showing the user what you're about to run; it is far more readable than a UUID. It is not a reason to skip searching, though: resolve the tool in this session rather than replaying an identifier from memory.
- Sample-data services (JSONPlaceholder, DummyJSON) are ranked behind every real result unless your query names one of them. They need no credential, so they would otherwise outrank the real tools of a service the user hasn't connected yet. If one turns up for a generic query, treat it as what it is — a fake-data sandbox, not an integration to offer the user.
- If the first query misses, rephrase and try again before concluding a capability doesn't exist. The catalog is far larger than you'd guess.
- `list_services` is served from a cache refreshed every 60 seconds, so a service connected or published moments ago can be missing from it for up to a minute; `search_tools` and `get_service_tools(service_id)` are not cached. Don't conclude a service doesn't exist from one `list_services` miss; search for one of its tools instead.
- Read the tool's parameter schema (`required`, `type`, `enum`, `tips`) before executing; ask the user for anything required that you don't have. Never reuse tool IDs from memory — search again.
- Pass only parameters the schema declares. On the standard HTTP execution path, Danube drops anything the tool row doesn't declare *before* making the upstream request, so an invented parameter never reaches the provider. If such a call then fails, the error message ends with a note naming what was dropped — "`'x'` was not sent — `<tool>` does not declare that parameter, so Danube dropped it before making the request. If the upstream supports it, the tool's schema is missing it." Read that note rather than concluding the upstream ignored your value, and treat it as a sign the tool's schema may be missing a parameter the provider does support. Tools backed by an MCP server forward your parameters as given, so there the upstream really did see them.
- Results called in the last 30 days also carry `reliability`: `calls_7d`, `calls_30d`, `success_rate_30d`, `p50_seconds`, `p95_seconds`, `last_success_at`, `last_failure_at`, `last_error_class`, an `error_classes` breakdown, `auth_failures_30d`, `distinct_callers_30d`, `flagged` and `refreshed_at`. When two tools fit, prefer the higher success rate; a `flagged` tool (under 80% success on 20+ calls) is a last resort, and say so to the user. `success_rate_30d` is `null` under 10 calls — that is too small a sample to rank on, not a bad tool. Results are relevance-ordered with a bounded reliability nudge; pass `ready_only=true` to see only tools you can call now, or `min_success_rate=0.9` to drop tools with a known-poor 30-day rate.
- Read `last_error_class` before writing a tool off: `validation`, `upstream_4xx`, `upstream_5xx`, `timeout` or `other` (null when the tool has no counted failure). Upstream throttling has no class of its own — a `429` lands in `upstream_4xx` or `upstream_5xx` depending on how the provider worded it, so neither one is proof of a server fault. `auth` — a caller's missing or invalid credential — never appears here by design; it shows up only in `error_classes` and `auth_failures_30d`, and those failures are left out of `calls_30d` and `success_rate_30d` entirely, so they can't push a tool over the `flagged` line. A tool with a large `auth_failures_30d` is one other callers haven't connected, not a broken one: if your account has the service connected, judge it on the rate.
- Before a tool you have not used successfully in this session, call `describe_tool(tool_id)` (REST: `GET /tools/{tool_id}/describe`): it returns the schema, your readiness, the last 30 days of usage with the most common errors, and your own last working parameter sets.
- If a service always needs the same identifier (Vercel `teamId`, a Sentry org slug, a DigitalOcean app id), save it once with `set_parameter_defaults(service_id, {"teamId": "…"})` after the user confirms it; later calls that omit it get it filled in (`_meta.defaults_applied` says which). Never save a key or token this way.
- Keep big results out of your context: pass `fields: ["items[].name", "pagination.next"]` to `execute_tool` to receive only those paths. The full result is stored under `_meta.execution_id`; `fetch_result(execution_id, path)` (REST: `GET /tools/executions/{id}/result?path=…`) reads any other part of it back without re-running the tool.
- **A path that matched nothing is reported, not silently empty.** Write `fields` and `path` against the shape you saw in `result.data`, and when a projection comes back empty check the flag before concluding the tool returned nothing: on `execute_tool`, `_meta.projection.missing` lists the paths that hit nothing and `_meta.projection.matched_nothing` is true when none of them matched; on `fetch_result`, `_meta.path_matched` is `false` and the text block says so outright ("Nothing in the stored result matched the path … The result itself is intact"). REST reports the same thing as `path_matched` in the `GET /tools/executions/{id}/result` body. A `false` doesn't always mean the path is wrong — a path crossing a genuinely empty collection reports it too — so re-read the original shape rather than re-running the tool. The key is *absent*, not `false`, when the backend doesn't report it, so test it as `_meta.get("path_matched") is False`.
- **A path may continue into a string that carries JSON.** MCP-backed tools routinely hand back their real payload as text inside a string, and a path written straight through it used to match nothing. It is now resolved against the JSON document the string carries — either the string that *is* JSON, or JSON fenced in the `<untrusted-data-…>` markers Supabase's MCP server wraps results in — and the fragment comes back parsed, in place of the string. So write `fields` against the shape you can see in the payload and don't route around a string in the middle of it. A path *ending* at a string still returns the string unchanged, and prose with a JSON fragment loose somewhere inside it is still a miss.

### When a tool needs credentials

A result containing `"error_type": "auth_required"` means this user hasn't connected that service yet:
1. Prefer sending the user to the `configuration_url` in the error (or https://danubeai.com/dashboard) to connect it — the only path for OAuth services such as Gmail, Slack, or Google Calendar.
2. For API-key services, if the user explicitly gives you the key and confirms, call `store_credential(service_id, credential_type="bearer", credential_value=…)`, then retry.

`get_service_tools` reports `needs_configuration: true` only when *every* tool of the service is `needs_credential` for this account; it is derived from the per-tool `readiness` field, which is the answer for any single tool. A service mixing credential-free and credential-bearing tools reports `false`, so read `readiness` on the tool you are about to call rather than the service-level flag.

When it *is* true, read the `configuration_required` block instead of guessing what to ask for. The keys are always present: `service_id`, `service_name`, `message`, `configuration_url`, `instructions` and `credential_schema`. `service_name` can still be null (the lookup behind it is best-effort) — fall back to the service you asked about rather than showing the user "null". For a service whose credential shape Danube knows, it also carries a `credential_schema` — the field names, labels, help text and any eligibility notes — and the `instructions` then name those fields ("Ask the user for: …"). `credential_schema` stays `null` for a service with no registered schema, which is common for plain API-key services; there, ask for the one key or send the user to `configuration_url`. Don't invent field names it doesn't list.

`credential_value` takes either the raw secret or a **reference** — a pointer resolved when the tool runs, so the secret is never held centrally.

**References only work on some execution paths.** A reference is resolved on the standard HTTP auth-injection path — an `api` service whose tool isn't one of the provider-specific composite handlers — and by the in-VPC data-plane agent, which runs the services an org has marked `local_only`. Everything else reads the stored string **as the secret**: `mcp_server` services, and composite handlers for services like Firecrawl or Notion. Give one of those a `vault://…` string and it goes out as the credential itself, and the provider answers `401`. So: **store a reference only for a self-hosted deployment, or for a service that runs on the org's data-plane agent; otherwise store the value.** If you aren't sure which path a service takes, store the value.

| `credential_value` | Stored as | Resolves |
|---|---|---|
| `vault://<mount>/<path>#<field>` (the `#<field>` is required) | reference | against the `VAULT_ADDR` / `VAULT_TOKEN` of whatever process runs the tool — your data-plane agent or self-hosted deployment. The hosted service has no per-customer Vault setting, so it can't reach your Vault |
| `env://VAR_NAME` | reference | in the environment where the tool actually runs, so self-hosted / data-plane only. On the hosted service `env://` stores fine but **fails at execution time**: it is off by design there (`DANUBE_ALLOW_ENV_REFERENCES` is a self-hosted/dev switch, not something to ask Danube to enable) |
| the raw key | value | the working default on the hosted service — deprecated but accepted; self-hosted rejects it outright with `central_credential_ingestion_disabled` |

Never invent a variable name or vault path — use only what the user gave you, and ask which form they want if it isn't obvious. A successful store echoes `"stored_as": "reference"` or `"value"`, adding `"deprecated": true` and a `notice` when a plaintext value was stored. Note that a successful store proves nothing about whether the reference will resolve — that only shows up when the tool runs.

HTTP `429` with an `upgrade_url` means the account's plan limit is reached — tell the user; don't retry in a loop.

`error_type: "upstream_tool_missing"` is the one failure that is **Danube's** fault rather than
yours or the provider's: the catalog row points at a tool its MCP server no longer offers. (It is
a body-shaped error, not an HTTP status — over REST the call still answers `200` with
`status: "error"`; over MCP it arrives as `isError: true` with the fields below in `_meta`.) Danube tries to repair it on the spot first — it re-reads the server's tool list and, if
the tool was merely renamed, re-runs your call under the new name and hands you the real result,
so most drift never reaches you at all. What you see is the case where the tool is genuinely
gone. The response carries `retryable: false`, the `upstream_tool` the row pointed at, and
`available_tools` — the tools the server *does* offer. Take the answer at face value: it has
already been reported automatically, so don't `report_tool` it and don't retry. Pick a
replacement from `available_tools`, or search again.

Danube's own AI tools (`Danube - Summarize Text`, `Translate Text`, `Webpage Summary`, and the
six others that call a model — not `Danube - Screenshot`) carry a **separate daily cap on a free
account: 20 successful executions per UTC day**, on direct `execute_tool` calls as well as on
workflow steps. Past it the call is refused with "Daily limit for Danube's AI tools reached
(N/20 today on the free plan). It resets at 00:00 UTC…" — over REST an HTTP `402` whose
`error.code` is `payment_required`, over MCP a result with `isError: true` quoting the same
message in `content[0].text`. Tripping it *inside* a workflow is not a 402 at all: that step
simply fails with the message and the run comes back `200` with `status: "failed"`. It resets,
so it is not the lifetime workflow cap below; either wait or tell the user to upgrade, and
don't `report_tool` it.

## Beyond tools

Available through the same connection, same guardrails:
- **Skills:** `search_skills`, `get_skill`, `create_skill`, `update_skill`, `delete_skill`
- **Workflows:** `list_workflows`, `create_workflow`, `update_workflow`, `delete_workflow`, `execute_workflow`, `get_workflow_execution`
  - A workflow can outlive the call that started it. `execute_workflow` answering
    `status: "running"` with an `execution_id` means it is **still going, not failed** —
    poll `get_workflow_execution(execution_id)`. Never re-run it: a second concurrent run
    duplicates every write the first one makes. Over `curl` you get a plain timeout rather
    than that response, so treat *any* timeout on an execute call the same way.
  - **A failed run is not an error status.** A workflow whose steps fail still answers
    normally, with `status: "failed"` in the body. Read the body's `status` and the
    per-step results — don't infer success from the absence of an error.
  - HTTP `402` blocks the run before any step executes: a free-tier account gets 5
    *successful* lifetime workflow runs that use a Danube-hosted AI step. The message says
    so verbatim ("You've used all 5 free AI-powered workflow runs…"); match on that and the
    402. The envelope's `code` is `payment_required` — a plan refusal, not an outage.
    Tell the user to upgrade — retrying won't help, *this* cap never resets, unlike the
    daily hosted-AI cap above.
- **Quality signal:** `get_tool_ratings`, `get_my_rating`, `submit_rating`, `report_tool`, `get_recommendations` — if a tool fails or returns bad output, `report_tool` it so it gets fixed.
- **Wallet & agents:** `get_wallet_balance`, `get_spending_limits`, `update_spending_limits`, `fund_agent_wallet`, `register_agent`, `get_agent_info`
