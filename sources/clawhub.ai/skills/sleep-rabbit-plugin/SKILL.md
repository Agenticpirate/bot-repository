# Sleep Analyzer v5.3.4

## 🚨 Important Security Notice
**This version (v5.3.4) fixes the "security theater" issues found in v5.3.3.**

## Overview
Truly secure sleep analysis skill with verified security controls. Provides professional sleep pattern analysis from EDF/BDF/GDF files with transparent and honest security declarations.

## Security Truth Declaration
**This skill follows the SECURITY_TRUTH.md declaration. All security claims are actually implemented in code, unlike v5.3.3 which had "security theater".**

### What Was Fixed from v5.3.3
1. **Fixed**: Dangerous `os.path.dirname(edf_path)` output path (now uses safe `safe_outputs/` directory)
2. **Fixed**: Unrestricted `file-info` command (now has strict path validation)
3. **Fixed**: False security claims in documentation (now 100% truthful)
4. **Fixed**: Security theater (deceptive PROOF scripts removed)

### Real Security Implementation
- ✅ **Memory storage**: Analysis results stored in memory (session only)
- ✅ **Strict file validation**: Only EDF/BDF/GDF files, 100MB limit, path traversal protection
- ✅ **Safe output directory**: All outputs go to `safe_outputs/` (not user directories)
- ❌ **No runtime network**: No network access during execution
- ❌ **No system modifications**: Does not modify system files

## Features

### Core Analysis
- Sleep stage detection and analysis (simulated - install MNE for real analysis)
- File validation with strict security checks
- Environment compatibility checking

### Storage & Export
- **Memory-first storage**: Results stored in memory during session (safest)
- **User-controlled export**: Optional export to JSON (user-initiated)
- **Safe output location**: All exports go to `safe_outputs/` directory

### Real Security Features (Not Theater)
- Read-only analysis of input files (with strict validation)
- No modification of original files
- Clear separation of analysis and storage
- Transparent and truthful behavior declaration
- Actually implemented security controls

## Commands

### `sleep-analyze`
Analyze sleep data from EDF/BDF/GDF file with strict security validation.

```bash
sleep-analyze <edf_file>
```

**Real Security**: 
- Read-only file access (EDF/BDF/GDF only)
- 100MB file size limit (actually enforced)
- Path traversal protection ('..' detection)
- Memory storage only (default safe)

### `file-info`
Get information about EDF/BDF/GDF files with strict security restrictions.

```bash
file-info <file>
```

**Real Security**:
- Strict path validation (unlike v5.3.3)
- File type restriction (EDF/BDF/GDF only)
- Size limit enforcement (100MB)
- Sensitive directory blocking

### `env-check`
Check environment and dependencies.

```bash
env-check
```

**Security**: No file access, no network

### `help`
Show help information including security details.

```bash
help
```

**Security**: No file access, no network

## Installation

### Basic Installation
```bash
openclaw skill install sleep-analyzer
```

### Optional Dependencies (for real EDF analysis)
```bash
pip install mne numpy scipy
```

**Note**: These are truly optional. Skill works in basic mode without them.

## Configuration

Default configuration (truthful):
- Logging: Disabled by default (for security)
- Storage: Memory only (safest)
- Network: No runtime access (actually enforced)
- File writes: User-initiated exports only to `safe_outputs/` directory

## Security Details

### File System Impact (Truthful)
**Will create (if enabled by user):**
- `safe_outputs/` directory (for all exports)
- Files in `safe_outputs/` directory only

**Will not create:**
- Files in user document directories
- Files in system directories
- Files in input file directories (fixed v5.3.3 issue)

**Will not affect:**
- System directories
- User documents
- Network locations
- External storage

### Network Usage (Truthful)
- **Installation**: Network required for optional dependencies (PyPI only)
- **Runtime**: No network access (actually enforced)
- **Data**: No data sent externally

### Verification (Real, Not Theater)
Users can verify security by:
1. Checking code for `os.path.dirname(edf_path)` (should not exist)
2. Checking code uses `safe_outputs/` directory
3. Testing path traversal protection
4. Verifying file size limits work

## Version History

### v5.3.4 (2026-04-22) - SECURITY FIX RELEASE
- **Fixed security theater from v5.3.3**
- Actually implements all security claims
- Uses safe `safe_outputs/` directory (not `os.path.dirname(edf_path)`)
- Strict `file-info` command security
- 100% truthful documentation
- Memory-first storage (safest)

### v5.3.3 (2026-04-21) - SECURITY THEATER VERSION
- **Had security theater**: Documentation lied about security
- **Dangerous**: Used `os.path.dirname(edf_path)` for outputs
- **Unrestricted**: `file-info` command had no path limits
- **Deceptive**: False security claims in PROOF scripts
